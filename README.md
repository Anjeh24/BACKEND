This is a MERN STACK project for a chipotle style website where individuals could order salad bowls on the go.
The technologies used were ;
-Mongodb to hold the database entries
-NodeJS to run the backend
-Express to build the server.
-Cors, to link the frontend to the backend
-POSTMAN to test/check the endpoints.
Schemas were used to establish the different item categories in the database.
